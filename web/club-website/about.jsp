	<p class="c1"><span class="c2"><b>People:</b></span> Our club's
    members range from those with two left feet (and sometimes
    more) to veteran dancers with years of experience.&nbsp; We
    welcome anyone interested in learning and having fun, including
    Pittsburgh area undergraduate students, graduate students, and
    professionals.&nbsp; If you don't have a partner, no
    worries!&nbsp; We welcome singles and couples.</p>

    <br />

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2"><b>Dances:</b></span> We base
    our lessons on the International Latin (Cha-Cha, Rumba, Samba,
    Paso Doble, Jive) and Standard (Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Quickstep,
    Viennese Waltz) dances, but we also teach social dances like Salsa,
    Hustle, and Swing.&nbsp; We
    start by teaching the basics, so if you have ever wanted to
    learn to dance... we are the place to start!</p>

    <br />

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2"><b>Classes:</b></span>This year classes are
    named Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Social, and Advanced Social.
    There will be extra practices for the competition and demo teams.
    <br /></p>

    <br />

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2"><b>Social Dance:</b></span>
    After each Beginner lesson, we stick around to dance and
    socialize. If you have any questions you'd like to ask us in
    person, or would just like to see what new moves our members
    have learned, stop by during the social dance time (see the
    schedule). Both members and non-members are welcome.<br /></p>

    <br />

    <p class="c1"><b class="c3">Competition Team</b><span class=
    "c2"><b>:</b></span> T<span>he competition team is a great
    chance to push yourself to the next level, and to dance with a
    group of talented and highly motivated people.&nbsp; Expert
    dancers and novices welcome - competitions have levels ranging from
    Newcomer to Champ, and you register for the dances you
    want to perform. Join the CMU team at exciting events
    throughout the semester--we travel all over the East Coast,
    meet new people, and have a blast!</span><br /></p>

    <br />

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2"><b>Curious?</b></span> If you
    would like to try out an evening of dancing and fun, just show up
    to any Beginner lesson and take it for free!<br /></p>
