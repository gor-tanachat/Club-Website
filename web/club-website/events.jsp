<h2><a name="Events">About Other Events</a></h2>
<p>Check our <a href="calendar.jsp">Calendar page</a> for specific times and details about events. Geoff, the social chair, will be at the ones with stars if you want a familiar face!</p>

<h3><a name="SpecialActivities">Special  Club Activities</a></h3>
<p>On occasion (Halloween, Valentines day), the  club will throw large events for a minimal fee including lessons, food and fun!</p>

<h3><a name="WeeklySocials">Weekly Social Dances</a></h3>
<p>A social dance is held after each Newcomer and Social  classes from 10-11 PM on Mondays and Wednesdays. These are open to everyone and  are great times to practice dances you've learned, meet other club members, and  have fun! Feel free to make music requests and ask experienced members for help  or new steps.</p>

<h3><a name="LateNights">Late Nights, UC Fridays, and Social Dances</a></h3>
<p>Each semester, we have a variety of on-campus events which are free to all club members and CMU-affiliated people.  Late Nights and UC Fridays are events held in the UC, usually with a lesson in a dance like Hustle or Swing, a performance, music for dancing, games, etc.  Our social dances are more strictly ballroom, where we have a lesson and then Standard, Latin, Hustle, Swing, Salsa, or whatever type of music people request.  All of these events have drinks and refreshments provided and are great chances to bring friends who are new to ballroom.</p>

<h3><a name="Trips">Trips to USA Dance socials, salsa dancing, and more</a></h3>
<p>USA Dance Pittsburgh holds monthly dances, some of which are held at Chatham University and some of which are held at CMU in conjunction with our club.  Many of our members go to the Chatham dances, as well as salsa, swing, and other dances around Pittsburgh.  Though these are not official club trips, ask an officer if you're interested, or check out our <a href="links.jsp">Links page</a> for the home pages of some of these events.</p>

<h3><a name="Competitions">Competitions</a></h3>
<p>We go to about three competitions each semester, with some in Pittsburgh and some in the Midwest or East Coast.  These are amazing experiences, especially ones like the Ohio Star Ball (one of the biggest competitions in the US, with a world-class professional competition).  You dance <i>a lot</i>, watch awesome dancers, and get to hang out with the CMU Competition Team. : ) If you're interested in watching or participating in these, check out our page on <a href="competing.jsp">Competing</a>.</p>
