<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<hr>


<p><i>How can I become a member of the dance club?</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Membership costs are $25 per person with student id and $35 for the general public.
Membership covers our weekly professionally taught Social lessons on Wednesdays (8-10PM, Rangos) AND our Newcomer and Bronze lessons on Mondays (8-10PM, Rangos). 
</ul>

<p><i>Do I have to bring a partner? </i></p>
<ul>
<li>No, a partner is not necessary at lessons. As a matter of fact, we encourage people to rotate partners in order to facilitate learning and socialization.
</ul>

<p><i> Who teaches the lessons?</i></p>

<ul>
<li> All lessons are professionally taught with the exception of the Newcomer lessons and one hour of the Gold lessons, which are taught by our advanced students.
</ul>

<p><i>What Lessons should I attend? </i></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are new to ballroom dancing, we recommend you start with the Newcomer and Social lessons. If you have some previous dance experience and/or want to challenge yourself by learning some technique to go along with the steps, come to the Bronze lessons as well.
<li>If you've learned all there is to know at the Social lessons, and are ready for more complicated moves taught at a quicker pace, try the Advanced Social lessons.
<li>As for international dances, except for Newcomer and Bronze (which could be done concurrently), it is recommended that you complete at least one semester of the previous level before moving onto the next one. In some cases, a full year may be necessary. But if you think you are ready to advance to the next level, ask an officer about tryouts!
</ul>

<p><i> What is the difference between American style dancing and International style dancing?</i></p>

<ul>
<li> American style dancing was developed by major U.S. Ballroom studios while international style dancing was developed by the British. In many parts of the world, only international style is used but in North America, both styles are used. In competitions, you can compete in both styles.
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Some major differences include that American Rhythm is danced on bent legs while International Latin is danced on straight legs. American Smooth dancing has a lot more open and individual steps while International Standard is danced in a closed position most of the time.
</ul>

<p><i> Do I have to compete?</i></p>

<ul>
<li> No one is required to compete but it is encouraged that you do so! It is a great experience and will really help you advance in your dancing. You will also be able to see other competitors, watch professional performances and get inspired to learn more ballroom!
</ul>

<p><i> What are DA's</i></p>

<ul>
<li> DAs are Dance Assistants! One ballroom officer will be available to help out at every American lesson and Bronze International lessons. This officer will be the dance assistant to help you out when you need a review on a step that has already been covered, help the instructor demonstrate steps, come around and give tips and just be available to ask questions!
</ul>

<p><i>What are tryouts? </i></p>

<ul>
<li>Tryouts demonstrate a dancer's ability and are one of the determining factors for placement into our more advanced classes. Any individual who is interested in advancing should talk to an officer to be put on the tryout list. A separate date for tryouts will be announced when everyone interested should come prepared to dance.
</ul>

<p><i> What  do we look at Tryouts? </i></p>
<ul>
<li> We look at tryouts like a dance competition. If the dancer is confident in dancing in the silver level, they may advance to our Gold lessons.
</ul>

<p><i>How long the Tryout results are valid?</i></p>
<ul>
<li> Tryout results hold for the semester, but we encourage dancers to keep practicing and try out for the next semester!
</ul>
