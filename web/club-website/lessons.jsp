<h1>Lesson Details</h1>

<p>By becoming a basic member, you enjoy the  benefits of attending our Social and Newcomer classes, which are all open to complete beginners, and taught by our advanced students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are enthusiastic and want to progress  faster, we encourage you to talk to the officers to attend the harder lessons  in addition to the ones at your current level. Hard work and practice can go a  long way in progressing your dancing and will get you ready for tryouts for  Bronze and Silver lessons, which are conducted by professional instructors. Also, definitely ask experienced members about steps  and technique outside of the lessons if you have questions! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extra practice: Extra Practice times are  available after the lessons every Monday from 10-11 PM and after the Social  lessons every Wednesday from 10-11 PM, where we play music for practice and  social dancing! We also schedule extra practice times before competitions, so  make sure to ask about those.</p>
<br />

<h2><a name="beginner_lessons">Beginner Lessons</a></h2>
<p>Our beginner lessons are perfect for those absolutely  new to ballroom, as well as for established dancers to learn more dances! With  a social lesson and two newcomer lessons taught each week,  participation in the beginner lessons in the fall semester will allow you to  learn 17 dances over the course of the semester. The Basic membership includes  BOTH of these lessons! Also, as is true with all of our lessons and in the  past, your first lesson is FREE! You don't know that you love it until you try--just  drop by to any lesson to join in!</p>
<br />
  
<h3><a name="beginner_social">Social (Wednesdays 8-9 PM and 9-10 PM)</a></h3>
<p>Want to learn how to look good on the dance  floor? Show off at weddings or social events? This is the class for you! These  classes are aimed at the complete beginner-no previous experience or partner is  required! Just come open to learn! Taught by advanced competition team members,  Spring 2011 Semester classes will feature 2 separate hour long classes of  social dancing and are the perfect way to get started in ballroom dance! In  just a few lessons, you'll be gliding across the floor with social and American  style dances such as Rumba, Foxtrot, Swing, Tango, Waltz, Hustle and Salsa!</p>

<h3><a name="newcomer">Newcomer  (Mondays 8-9 PM)</a></h3>
<p>Learn the international style of ballroom  dancing that's done all over the world! Our advanced competition team members will teach  you all the moves and technique to do HOT latin dances (such as Rumba, Cha-cha,  Samba, Jive and Paso doble) and to glide with standard dances (such as the  Quickstep, Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot and Viennese Waltz). With one-hour classes  featuring different dances every 4 weeks, no experience is necessary and we'll  teach you everything you need to know! </p>


<br />
<br />


<h2><a name="advanced_lessons">Advanced Lessons</a></h2>
<p>Learned all the basics already? Take your  dancing to the next level by taking part in our advanced lessons! Both Bronze,  Silver AND Advanced Social lessons are included in the Advanced membership price ($10  more to upgrade from basic). Note: Entry in the Silver class requires passing  of tryouts (held at the last lesson in the set preceding the class you wish to  attend&mdash;ask any officer for more information).</p>
<br />

<h3><a name="bronze">Bronze (Mondays 8-9 PM)</a></h3>
<p>Continue  learning the international style and brush up your new moves with technique to  bring your dancing to the next level! The bronze classes this semester feature  different dances, but teach technique applicable to dances you have learned  before.</p>
<br />

<h3><a name="silver">Silver (Wednesdays 6-7 PM)</a></h3>
<p>Our professionally taught Silver lessons will  feature Silver level ISTD syllabus steps to advance your dancing in the  international style! Spring 2011 features Paso Doble, Cha-cha, Quickstep,  Samba, and Foxtrot!</p>
<p>Note: Tryouts are required to attend the Silver  classes&mdash;knowledge of a list of bronze steps must be demonstrated, as well as  basic technique. It is highly recommended that dancers participating in these  classes have an understanding of the dance being taught (knowledge of the  rhythm of the dance and basic steps) as basic steps in the dance will not be  explained in depth.</p>
<br />

<h3><a name="advanced_social">Advanced Social (Wednesdays 7-8 PM)</a></h3>
<p>Sick of learning the basic over and over? The  advanced social class features silver and gold level American steps as well as  advanced maneuvers and figures in social dances so you can really show off on  the dance floor! This semester's classes will feature East Coast Swing, Salsa,  Tango, and Viennese Waltz!</p>
<p>Note: As with the Silver lessons, it is  encouraged for Advanced Social lesson participants to be familiar with the  dance being taught as basic steps in the dance will not be explained in depth.  Lessons will progress quickly, but no tryout is required to attend.</p>

<a name="TryOut"></a>
<p><b>" * " Tryouts are required for Silver and Gold Lessons</b></p>
<br /><p>Tryouts demonstrate a dancer's ability and are one of the determining
factors for placement into our more advanced classes. Any individual who
is interested in advancing should talk to an officer to be put on the
tryout list. A separate date for tryouts will be announced when everyone
interested should come prepared to dance in all dances-a partner is not
necessary but highly recommended (if you do not have a partner, an officer
will dance with you). To give you insight on what we look for, we look at
tryouts like a dance competition. If the dancer is confident in the bronze
level, they will be let into our Silver lessons, similarly, if the dancer
is confident in silver, they may advance to our Gold lessons. Tryout
results hold for the semester, but we encourage dancers to keep practicing
and try out for the next semester! </p><br />
